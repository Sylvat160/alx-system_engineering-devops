## What is a Computer Network?
A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and other networking hardware, that are linked together to facilitate communication and data sharing. Networks can be local (LAN), spanning multiple locations (WAN), or global (Internet).

## Types of Networks
- Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN connects devices within a limited area, such as a home, office, or campus.
- Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN spans a large geographic area and connects LANs or other networks together.
- Metropolitan Area Network (MAN): A MAN covers a city or metropolitan area, providing high-speed connections.
- Wireless Network: Wireless networks use radio waves or infrared signals to transmit data without physical cables.
- Virtual Private Network (VPN): A VPN creates a secure, encrypted connection over a public network, ensuring privacy.

## Network Components
- Network Interface Card (NIC): A NIC enables a device to connect to a network, providing a unique MAC address.
- Router: Routers forward data packets between different networks, directing traffic based on IP addresses.
- Switch: Switches connect multiple devices within a network, facilitating communication at the data link layer.
- Modem: A modem converts digital signals to analog for transmission over telephone lines or cable systems.
- Hub: Hubs are older networking devices that pass on all incoming data to all connected devices.
- Firewall: Firewalls protect networks by monitoring and controlling incoming and outgoing network traffic.

## TCP/IP Protocol Suite
The TCP/IP protocol suite is a set of networking protocols that enables communication between devices on the Internet. It consists of two main protocols:
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented data transmission, ensuring data integrity.
- Internet Protocol (IP): IP is responsible for addressing and routing packets across networks, enabling end-to-end communication.

## IP Addressing
- IP address: An IP address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network, allowing them to communicate.
- IPv4: IPv4 addresses are 32-bit numbers expressed in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.0.1).
- IPv6: IPv6 addresses are 128-bit hexadecimal numbers, offering a larger address space to accommodate the growing number of devices.

## Domain Name System (DNS)
The Domain Name System (DNS) translates human-readable domain names (e.g., www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers understand. DNS servers maintain a distributed database to facilitate this translation.

## Ports and Protocols
- Port: A port is a communication endpoint in an operating system that enables multiple applications to share a single IP address.
- Protocol: A protocol is a set of rules governing data transmission and communication between devices.
- Common Protocols: Examples of common protocols include HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), FTP (21), SSH (22), and DNS (53).

## Firewalls
A firewall is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It helps protect against unauthorized access and threats.

## Network Address Translation (NAT)
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a technique that allows multiple devices on a LAN to share a single public IP address. NAT modifies IP addresses in packet headers to facilitate communication between private and public networks.

## Web Stack Debugging
Web stack debugging refers to the process of identifying and resolving issues in the components of a web application's technology stack. It involves troubleshooting errors or malfunctions in the web server, database, application code, or other related components to ensure proper functionality.

## Conclusion
Understanding network basics is essential for effectively managing and troubleshooting computer networks. This document provided an overview of key concepts, components, and protocols related to computer networks, along with an introduction to web stack debugging.
